# 💧 Smart Turbidity-Based Water Quality Prediction


## About the Project

This project is a **Machine Learning–based turbidity analysis system** designed to evaluate **irrigation water quality**.
Using **turbidity values** as input, the system classifies water into **Good, Medium, or Bad** categories and provides **risk-based recommendations**.

The project demonstrates a **complete ML workflow** — from data preprocessing and model training to **real-time prediction via a Streamlit dashboard**.

## Why This Project?

* Water turbidity directly affects irrigation efficiency
* Poor water quality can damage crops and soil
* Machine Learning enables **fast & automated decision-making**
* Scalable for **IoT + smart agriculture systems**

## Working Principle (High-Level)

1. **Input:** Turbidity value (sensor/manual)
2. **Model:** Decision Tree Classifier
3. **Processing:** Learns patterns from historical data
4. **Output:** Water quality category
5. **Action:** Displays safety status & recommendations

##  Water Quality Classification

| Turbidity Level | Prediction | Meaning               |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Low             |  Good     | Safe for irrigation   |
| Medium          |  Medium  | Treatment recommended |
| High            |  Bad     | Unsafe for irrigation |
